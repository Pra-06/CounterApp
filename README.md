# CounterApp

An Increment/Decrement Counter App built with React is a simple web application that allows users to increase or decrease a numerical value using buttons. The app showcases basic React concepts like state management, event handling, and re-rendering. In this app, the counter value is stored in React's state, and the user can interact with two main buttons: one to increment the value and another to decrement it.

When the user clicks the "Increment" button, the counter value increases by 1, while the "Decrement" button reduces it by 1. The counter value is displayed in real-time on the screen, updating instantly with each button press. The app can be easily customized, for example, by adding a reset button to set the counter back to zero, or a step feature to allow the counter to increase or decrease by values other than 1.

The app leverages React's useState hook to manage the current value and handle updates. Reactâ€™s reactivity ensures that the UI updates automatically whenever the state changes, creating a smooth and interactive user experience. This type of app is a great starting point for beginners to learn React fundamentals while building something functional and engaging.
